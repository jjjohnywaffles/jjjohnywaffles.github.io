    <title>Weekly Update 6</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>This past week was quite productive as I managed to find a potential data source that aligns well with my project requirements. The dataset contains customer demographic information, purchase histories, and behavioral patternsâ€”all of which will be crucial for accurate segmentation. Additionally, I researched various clustering methods and settled on K-means clustering as the initial approach for segmentation.</p>
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>For this week, my main priority will be to explore and clean the dataset, ensuring that it is ready for analysis. This involves handling any missing or inconsistent data, standardizing attributes, and preparing the features that will be used in the clustering model. Alongside data preparation, I'll start implementing the K-means clustering algorithm to generate some results and evaluate how well it segments the customer data.</p>
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>While finding the data source was a significant step forward, the data preprocessing phase might be more challenging than expected. Dealing with issues like missing values, outliers, and feature scaling could take an unprecedented amount of time. Furthermore, balancing this project with other academic responsibilities, such as exams and coursework, remains an ongoing challenge.</p>
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Focusing on specific tasks like identifying a data source and selecting a clustering method was a beneficial strategy. It allowed me to break down the project into manageable chunks, which helped in maintaining focus and achieving tangible milestones.</p>
