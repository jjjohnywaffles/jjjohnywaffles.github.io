    <title>Weekly Update 8</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, due to some other commitments, my work on the project was somewhat minimal. However, I managed to find a basic framework and template for my personal website, which gives me a solid foundation to build on in the coming weeks. This framework will help me streamline my progress once I’m able to focus more fully on the project.</p>
    
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I plan to start building out the structure of the website using HTML and CSS, incorporating the template I found. If time allows, I’ll begin adding interactivity with JavaScript. Additionally, I plan to continue updating the GitHub page hosting my project updates with an aim to eventually use it as my main personal page.</p>
    
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Balancing this side project with my other academic responsibilities remains the biggest challenge. I need to ensure I stay on track with my main goals while making steady progress on my personal webpage setup.</p>
    
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Taking time to find a basic template and framework last week was beneficial as it set a clear starting point for the page. Moving forward, creating a project timeline with specific milestones would help maintain focus and ensure I’m progressing steadily without getting caught up in any one aspect of development.</p>
