    <title>Weekly Update 7</title>

    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>This past week has been slower than I anticipated, primarily due to the heavy load of exams and assignments from my other courses. I was able to make some minor progress in exploring the dataset, but I haven’t been able to dedicate as much time as I would have liked to the data cleaning process. The focus was mainly on reviewing the dataset and identifying some of the inconsistencies and missing values that will need to be addressed.</p>
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>Given the ongoing academic commitments, my goal this week is to make gradual progress on cleaning the dataset. Specifically, I aim to start addressing the missing values and work on feature scaling where necessary. I’ll also try to squeeze in some time to begin implementing the K-means clustering algorithm, though it may be limited.</p>
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Time management continues to be a significant challenge, especially with multiple exams and coursework that require attention. The complexity of cleaning the dataset is also proving to be more involved than I initially expected, and I anticipate that balancing both will be tricky in the coming days.</p>
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Last week’s focus was too broad, and with the added pressure of exams, it became difficult to make substantial progress. Moving forward, I’ll need to set smaller, more achievable goals that can fit within my limited availability. This way, I can ensure that progress is still being made, even if it’s slower than initially planned.</p>
