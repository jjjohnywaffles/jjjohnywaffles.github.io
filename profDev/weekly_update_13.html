    <title>Weekly Update 13</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, I completed the base structure of my portfolio website. This included implementing core features and styling the layout using HTML and CSS. The website now has a good foundation to start integrating my projects presentations in the upcoming weeks.</p>

    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I will begin adding my projects to the portfolio site. Additionally, I am nearing the completion of my k-means analysis, which I plan to finalize and document for inclusion in the portfolio.</p>

    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Time continues to be a limiting factor due to my commitments in other classes. However, with the base of the website completed, I feel confident in making steady progress as I start adding content.</p>

    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Focusing on completing the foundational structure of the website proved to be an effective approach. Moving forward, allocating specific time slots to update and refine the portfolio site each week should ensure that I stay on track. Additionally, completing the k-means analysis will free up more time for web development tasks.</p>
