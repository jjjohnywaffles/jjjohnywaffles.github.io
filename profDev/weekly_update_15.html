    <title>Weekly Update 15</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, I successfully finalized my implementation of the KMeans analysis program. This included testing and debugging the code to ensure accurate clustering and predictive capabilities. The program is now able to provide information regarding customer purchasing habits. Additionally, I explored ways to integrate these insights into visualizations, making the results more accessible and actionable.</p>

    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>I plan on finalizing my report on my experience working through both this project and developing a website.</p>

    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>With the near completion of exams, I now have more time to dedicate to this project. Besides balancing studying with working everything is going smoothly.</p>

    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Last week, focusing solely on finalizing the KMeans analysis allowed me add the final touches to the program. Following my previous strategies of blocking out times to work on certain assignments definitely helps keep me on track. </p>
