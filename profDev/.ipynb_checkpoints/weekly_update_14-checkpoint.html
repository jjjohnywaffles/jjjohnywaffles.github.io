    <title>Weekly Update 14</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, I was preparing for numerous final projects and exams, which demanded most of my time and focus. As a result, I was unable to finalize my k-means analysis. However, I made significant progress on my personal website, continuing to refine its structure and layout. This included organizing content and planning the integration of my projects.</p>

    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I aim to further develop my personal website by integrating some of my past projects and improving its interactivity. While the k-means analysis remains on hold, I plan to revisit it after my exams to finalize and include it in my portfolio.</p>

    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Final exams and project deadlines are the main impediments, significantly limiting my time for personal projects. Balancing these academic commitments while making steady progress on my website is a challenge I am currently navigating.</p>

    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>I think I made the right decision putting this project on the backburner due to it's near completion. Moving forward, I plan to allocate dedicated time blocks for this personal project once exams are over, ensuring completion in the upcoming week.</p>
