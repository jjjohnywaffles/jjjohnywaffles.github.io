    <title>Weekly Update 12</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, I continued to build the foundation for my personal website, working with HTML and CSS to style the project update pages. I focused on making the site more visually appealing and functional, which provided a good framework to expand on in future updates.</p>
    
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I found a promising website template that aligns well with the design I envisioned. My main goal will be to start porting my content and existing structure over to this template. I hope that using a template will streamline the process, allowing me to implement more features to the site rather than starting from scratch. Furthermore, I intend on finalizing my implementation of my kmeans analysis.</p>
    
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Time management remains a challenge as I balance this project with my other classes. However, the template should help accelerate development and keep me on track even with my busy schedule.</p>
    
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Using a template going forward should improve the process by saving time on design, allowing me to focus more on content and functionality. Additionally, setting aside a dedicated block of time each week specifically for this project will help ensure consistent progress amidst other obligations.</p>
