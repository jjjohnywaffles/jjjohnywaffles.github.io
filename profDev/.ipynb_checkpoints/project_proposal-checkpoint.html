    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

    <p>Learning more advanced data Science and analytics. I'm looking to create a marketing tool to better understand customer habits alongside setting up a personal website.</p>

    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>

    <p>This project will expand my professional skills in data science by applying advanced analytics and potentially machine learning to customer segmentation. It aims to not only segment customers but also predict their future behaviors, enhancing my ability to create data oriented marketing strategies.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>I am deeply interested in both data science and data analytics, fields that continually evolve with new technologies. This project provides a perfect opportunity to showcase my newly developed skills and my willingness to learn more complex analytical techniques. By integrating detailed customer profiling into traditional customer segmentation, I aim to demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of how data can drive personalized marketing strategies and business decisions.</p>

    <h2>Specific and Measurable Goals</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Develop a customer segmentation model using clustering techniques.</li>

        <li>Enhance the model to predict customer behaviors such as the likelihood of purchasing specific items.</li>

        <li>Create personalized customer profiles that detail individual shopping habits and preferences.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Risks to Project Completion</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Learning about machine learning techniques may present a steep learning curve since I have very little exposure and understanding.</li>

        <li>Personalized profiling requires complex data integration and management.</li>

        <li>Balancing the sophisticated elements of the project with time constraints.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Mitigation Strategy</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Regularly schedule learning sessions to try and learn more regarding advanced machine learning concepts.</li>

        <li>Use data management tools most likely python libraries and visualization software such as PowerBi and Tableau to handle data structures.</li>

        <li>Prioritize project components to ensure key features are developed within the time frame.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Project Assessments</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>My main goal is to create a program that can accurately measure customer tendencies while also creating a portfolio showcase.</li>

        <li>Learn more on HTML and Javascript to properly format my website.</li>

    </ul>
