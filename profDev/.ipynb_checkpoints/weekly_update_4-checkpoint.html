    <title>Weekly Update 4</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>I refined the scope of my project, choosing Python for data management and starting on the data collection framework. I also initiated the design for my personal website to display project updates.</p>
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I’ll start testing different clustering techniques for the segmentation model and view educational material to better understand machine learning. I still want to ensure that the various techniques I have learned and researched are optimal for what I want to accomplish.</p>
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Balancing this project with other academic duties is challenging, and the steep learning curve in machine learning is a potential slow-down.</p>
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>I learned the value of a clearly defined scope. To improve, I’ll set specific weekly goals and schedule dedicated times for learning, aiming for more structured progress.</p>
