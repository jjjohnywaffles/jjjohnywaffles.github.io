    <h1>Weekly Update 2: Personal Website & Professional Development</h1>
    <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up personal website on GitHub: I set up the foundation of my personal website using GitHub Pages. I created a Git repository and initialized it with a basic HTML file to get familiar with GitHub Pages hosting. I’ve added some basic CSS styling and will refine it as I go.</li>
        <li>Researched web development frameworks: I compared Flask and Django for the back-end framework and decided to go with Flask because of its simplicity and flexibility for this small project. I also looked into Bootstrap to help speed up the front-end design process with responsive components.</li>
        <li>Explored database options: I researched various database management systems and chose MySQL for this project. I set up a local MySQL database and began testing basic queries. MySQL integrates well with Flask, and I’m already somewhat familiar with it, so it seems like a good fit for this project.</li>
        <li>Started working on website structure: I outlined the key sections for the site, including a portfolio page, a blog page (for weekly updates), and an interactive data visualization page to showcase one of my data science projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Build out the portfolio page: I’ll start by uploading details and visuals from my past projects.</li>
        <li>Start back-end development with Flask: Set up Flask routing to serve my static web pages, and design the back-end logic to dynamically render project data from the database onto the site.</li>
        <li>Set up MySQL integration: Connect my Flask application to the MySQL database and ensure that I can retrieve and display data on the website dynamically.</li>
        <li>Create first data visualization for the site: I’ll work on creating a data visualization (using Matplotlib most likely) to embed on the data science page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Time management continues to be a challenge as I balance this project with other commitments. I need to better prioritize tasks to make consistent progress.</li>
        <li>While I’m familiar with MySQL, integrating it with Flask is a new experience, so I’ll need to dedicate extra time to troubleshooting as I go.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h2>
    <p>What worked well: The initial setup of the GitHub Pages and project structure went smoothly, and researching Flask and MySQL has given me confidence in my chosen stack.</p>
    <p>What could be improved: I found myself spending too much time refining the front-end design when I should have focused on back-end setup. Moving forward, I’ll follow a more structured process by breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and prioritizing back-end functionality first.</p>
