    <title>Weekly Update 9</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, instead of focusing heavily on the data analysis portion, I spent a good amount of time researching how to set up a personal webpage using various programming languages and frameworks to fulfill the other half of my project proposal. I explored options in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end solutions like Flask and Node.js. My goal was to understand the best tools to use for creating a professional portfolio site that can showcase my work and projects in an organized manner.</p>
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I plan to build a basic version of my personal webpage. I’ll begin by laying out the structure in HTML and styling it with CSS. If time permits, I also intend to add some interactivity using JavaScript. Additionally, I continue to plan on updating the github page taht my project updates are hosted on to eventually be a personal page.</p>
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>The main challenge is balancing this work with other academic responsibilities. Since setting up a personal page is a side project compared to my goal, it’s important to ensure I stay on track with my other projects as well. </p>
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Last week, the process of researching different technologies helped me gain a clearer vision of how I want to structure my personal webpage. Moving forward, I could streamline the process by creating a project plan that sets out milestones for each stage of development. This will help me maintain focus and ensure steady progress without spending too much time on any one aspect of the page setup.</p>
