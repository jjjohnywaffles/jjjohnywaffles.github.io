    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Due to studying for an exam and managing other coursework, I wasn't able to dedicate much time to the project. However, I did take the opportunity to review my project scope and think through some possible improvements to the data collection framework. Furthermore, I am now deciding to create a basic GUI in order to interact with the project to create a more appealing product.</p>
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I'll resume work on testing clustering techniques for the segmentation model. Additionally, I plan to continue reviewing machine learning resources to enhance my understanding and ensure that I'm employing the right methods for the project's goals.</p>
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>Balancing the project alongside exams and other commitments remains a challenge. Finding adequate time to make steady progress continues to be a priority.</p>
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Although my progress was limited, I learned the importance of flexibility in managing multiple responsibilities. To improve, I plan to reassess my time management, setting achievable weekly milestones to ensure steady advancement even during busy periods.</p>
