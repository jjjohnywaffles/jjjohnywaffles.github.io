    <title>Weekly Update 3</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Last Week's Activities:</h1>
    <p>Last week, I deepened my understanding of the project's needs by researching various technologies. I explored using Flask and MySQL for a web application but realized they might not align with my project's plan. Alongside this, I began setting up my personal website on GitHub, which will host my project updates and final outcomes.</p>
    <h1>Plans for This Week:</h1>
    <p>This week, I'm looking to find the scope at which I want my project to encompass. Since I am limited on time due to taking 3 other classes, I want to ensure that my project is manageable. Finding what tools, software and data sources will definitely help me better understand what I can accomplish.</p>
    <h1>Impediments:</h1>
    <p>A key challenge is avoiding the trap of diving into unnecessary new technologies, which can distract from my project's main goals. Managing my time effectively and staying focused on essential tasks is crucial.</p>
    <h1>Reflection:</h1>
    <p>Last weekâ€™s exploration helped me refine my project's direction, though I noticed I spent time on technologies that may not be needed. This week, I plan to set clearer weekly goals to keep my efforts aligned with my project's core needs. I'm learning to be more selective with the tools I explore, ensuring they directly support my project. This focused approach will help streamline my progress and keep my project on track. Along with this, having an actual project idea will definitely help with better selecting the tools I want to use.</p>
