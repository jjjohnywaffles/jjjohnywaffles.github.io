# Derivative Calculator by Jonathan Hu

This folder contains an interactive **Derivative Calculator** project that allows users to explore and visualize polynomial derivatives directly on a webpage. It was designed as a personal challenge to port Python functionality into JavaScript and host it as a web application.

## Features

- Visualizes the original function, its first derivative, and its second derivative.
- User-friendly interface for entering polynomial functions.
- Dynamic graphing using JavaScript and Chart.js.

## Current Limitations

- **No Support for Complex Functions**: Functions involving trigonometric terms (`sin`, `cos`, etc.), or logarithms are not currently supported.
- **Planned Improvements**: Support for these more complex functions will be added in future updates.

## Python Prototype

The original version of this project was developed in Python, using **NumPy** and other libraries for numerical computation and visualization. A Jupyter Notebook included in this folder demonstrates the fleshed-out Python program, which has more functionality and proper graphs compared to the current JavaScript version.

### Why Port to JavaScript?

While Python provided a strong foundation for this project, the goal was to challenge myself and make the tool accessible via a webpage. JavaScript was chosen for its ability to power interactive web applications, though it presented challenges due to its differences from Python:

1. **Learning Curve**: JavaScript is not a language I am particularly familiar with, making this a challenging but rewarding learning experience.
2. **Web Hosting**: I wanted to learn how to host the program on a website and provide an easy-to-use interface for anyone to try.

## Future Plans

- Extend functionality to handle more complex mathematical expressions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic functions.
- Improve error handling and provide detailed feedback for invalid inputs.
