# Card Centering Tool

A web-based tool for measuring the centering of trading cards to assess potential center grading scores from major grading companies.

## Overview

The Card Centering Tool allows collectors and card enthusiasts to upload images of their trading cards and measure the centering with precision. The tool overlays adjustable border lines on the card image, calculates centering percentages, and provides potential grading assessments based on industry standards.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload card images via file selection, drag-and-drop, or clipboard paste (Ctrl+V)
- **Adjustable Borders**: Manually position inner and outer border lines to match card edges and design borders
- **Real-time Measurements**: Instantly view centering percentages for both vertical and horizontal axes
- **Grading Assessment**: See potential centering grades from PSA, BGS, CGC, and TAG
- **Rotation Control**: Slightly rotate the image to correct alignment issues

## How to Use

1. **Upload Your Card**: Click the "Upload Card Image" button, drag and drop an image onto the canvas, or use Ctrl+V to paste from clipboard
2. **Adjust Borders**: 
   - Drag the blue outer border lines to match the edges of the card
   - Drag the yellow inner border lines to match the design edges (print area)
3. **View Measurements**: See your centering percentages update in real-time below the image
4. **Check Grading Assessments**: Review potential grading scores based on the measured centering
5. **Fine-tune with Zoom**: Use zoom controls or mouse wheel to zoom in for more precise adjustments
6. **Correct Alignment**: Use the rotation slider if your card image is slightly rotated
