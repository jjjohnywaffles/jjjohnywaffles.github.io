    <title>Weekly Update 8</title>
</head>

    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, I managed to make significant progress in cleaning the dataset by writing and running several Python scripts. These scripts automated the process of identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries. I utilized the Pandas library to streamline data manipulation and ensure consistency across the dataset. The scripts also allowed me to efficiently scale features, setting up the dataset for the next phase of the project.</p>
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I plan to focus on finishing the data cleaning process and beginning the implementation of K-means clustering. With the dataset now in a much cleaner state, I expect the clustering to yield more accurate results. Additionally, I will experiment with different scaling methods to optimize model performance. Time permitting, I’ll also start visualizing the clusters to better understand customer segmentation patterns.</p>
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>The main challenge continues to be time management, as I’m balancing multiple projects and exams. However, the scripts I wrote have significantly reduced the manual workload of cleaning the dataset, which should make the rest of the process more manageable. I still anticipate that further adjustments may be needed once I start analyzing the clustering results.</p>
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p>Last week, focusing on automating the data cleaning process was a pivotal. By scripting the repetitive tasks, I was able to free up time and minimize human error. Moving forward, I will continue using automation where possible, particularly as I transition to the analysis phase. This approach not only improves efficiency but also allows for quicker iteration if further cleaning or adjustments are required.</p>
