    <title>Weekly Update 11</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>What did you do last week?</h1>
    <p>Last week, with my other classes picking up in pace, I found it challenging to dedicate as much time to this project as I would have liked. However, I did manage to work on setting up the foundation for my personal website, including adding some stylization effects to the project update website. This has given me a good starting point to work from as time allows.</p>
    
    <h1>What do you plan to do this week?</h1>
    <p>This week, I aim to start developing the core structure of the site with HTML and CSS to incorporate some already completed past projects alongside working working on completing my data analysis for the other half of my personal project. If I have additional time, I’ll begin adding JavaScript for interactivity. My goal is also to update my GitHub project page so that it gradually becomes my primary personal webpage.</p>
    
    <h1>Are there any impediments in your way?</h1>
    <p>The biggest impediment continues to be balancing this project with my other classes alongside work, which have significantly increased in workload. Allocating focused time for this project is becoming more difficult, but I’ll keep working out ways to make steady progress each week.</p>
    
    <h1>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h1>
    <p> Implementing basic CSS was helpful for building momentum, as it provided a clear starting point for the page. Moving forward, creating a flexible timeline with smaller, achievable goals might help keep the project manageable alongside my other coursework. This way, I can make consistent progress without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
